## Notes

### Images in HTML
> This setup isn't ideal, we are looking for alternatives. ðŸ˜ž

Images in HTML and other files that do not use a `require` statement (except for .scss) will not be picked up / watched by Webpack. A workaround has been added to __@static/@imgs__.

This workaround forces webpack to copy all image files under __@static/@imgs__ into the path specified in the loader configured to load images in __webpack.config.js__.

There are a couple of gotchas:


1. Any subdirs in __@imgs__ are discarded, so simply reference image paths like so: `{% raw %}{% static "imgs/path-to-file-no-subdir.png" %}{% endraw %}`.
2. All image files _must have unique names_.
3. If webpack isn't picking up new image files in __@imgs__ restart the `make assets` process.
